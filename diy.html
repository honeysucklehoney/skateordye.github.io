      I wrote this four months after moving back West from “Fogo Island”.
        <br>

|||| ||| 
        
        <br>

It’s the eighth day of the COVID-19 quarantine here and my first time encountering a global pandemic with social isolation measures. That being said, after moving to an island of 2500 people in the middle of the winter - alone - isolation feels rather familiar. 
<br>
 There are similarities in the time spent there and the paradigm now. Limited access to goods and services, solitude, performing various activities in “undesignated” spaces, staying within a small travel radius and often moving places by foot. Slowing down, the potential of dating shrunken, grappling with how to balance screen time as it becomes the emphasized way to connect socially, and making things yourself. The ideas we discuss in this publication about islands as sites for DIY feel even more relevant in this era of social isolation. As history cycles through, the notion of the periphery is beginning to dissolve and the lines between rural and urban fade. Self-determination returns to focus. In this paradigm, your community is your island.
 <br>
 I’m sitting alone in “China Creek Park,” a public skatepark and garden not far from my current rental home. It’s one of the oldest public skateparks in this city, and since skateboarding began on Turtle Island/“North America” it may be one of the oldest in the world. The park is built on unceded Coast Salish land, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations. You may know this place by the name “Vancouver.”
<br>
 It’s a sunny spring day but I feel a doom and a darkness inside. I’m scared about what sort of pressure this will put on an already shaky foundation of the globalized and colonized world. I am privileged to have the space to take social distance and within this racist, classist, ableist system, I know this pandemic will have much more serious and horrifying consequences on lives that aren’t mine. We need to stand in solidarity, not charity, with anti-racist movements to dismantle these oppressive systems. Not just now but always. It’s evident now more than ever that white supremacy is the pandemic.
<br>
 I look across the park and see two kids playing with a kite. They are helping each other throw it up in the air and run around as fast as they can so it catches in the wind. It soars above their small, running bodies until either they, or the wind, run out of energy. 
<br>
 The kite is made out of a thin, vibrantly coloured, synthetic fabric that glows in the sun. The way it catches invisible energy in the sky feels like some sort of visual representation of the way joy is experienced, jolting through your body. For whatever reason, watching them play makes me cry. Tears stream down my face and a meditation on play and survival begins in my mind.
 <br>
 I think to myself: what is play really and why exactly do children have such an amazing and - perhaps naive - ability to play even in times of crisis?
 <br>
 I think about:
<br>
 	Play theory
<br>
 		early childhood development 
<br>
                                              	     mental health
<br>
                                                 	                  education
<br>
                                                                                           toys 
<br>
and what all these things have in common with empowering or disempowering the user or the maker. I think about toy design and the introduction of manufactured toys to play and what this may have changed for our development as autonomous beings. I wonder if there would be a difference in the way these kids play with a store-bought kite vs. one that they made themselves. Would they carry and set it down on the ground differently? Perhaps with more care? Or maybe with more risk, because they possess the tools and knowledge to put it back together?
<br>
My mind moves to how I would like to make a kite. Funnily, at my age…and given that I went to art school, if I made a kite it may register as an art object or a sculpture instead of a toy. Even though I want to make one for the same reasons. I want to make a kite to run in the park and feel the way those kids feel. I wonder why we need to make things with such authority and what effect that has on our mental health and ability to problem solve.
<br>
I rack my brain for what materials I already have at home, to avoid making a non-essential trip to the store. These anti-capitalist parameters are a nice place to start asking questions of what a process could and should look like with less access to commercial goods and services. What is a good way to collect materials and why do we make the things we make? The social distancing is bringing us back to place-based and community centred making and it gives me some sort of hope. 
<br>
I look up and see the kids running really fast, this time with lots of wind catching the wings of the kite.
<br>
As it flaps my mind flutters to visions of what my kite would look like. I imagine the large scale paper maché sculptures made for the Bread and Puppet outdoor theatre shows and the kites in Colin Low’s short film “Children of Fogo Island.” I adore this film because It visually articulates so many of the loose parts in the spider web of my artistic research. Play theory, folk art and craft, participatory filmmaking, DIY making, and the periphery. 
<br>
Made in 1967, Low’s 18 minute black and white film documents children dancing and playing on the North Atlantic “Fogo Island” with toys and games they made themselves. From wood, textiles, string and other regional materials, they have created their own handmade mini houses, rafts, airplanes, boats, kites, and stilts. The first time I saw the film I fell in love with the handmade quality of the objects. Their outfits and toys look as if they were made by the artists of my dreams. Aesthetically, there are childlike, loose gestures of pastoral, naive, or folk art languages mixed with the reduction of the modernist context. 
<br>
About five minutes into the film, there is a scene of two little ones floating a DIY airplane across the ocean bay. Stretched across the side of the plane are hand painted letters which read: “EXPO 67.” A reminder that this moment was happening simultaneously to the international fair held in “Montreal, Quebec” in 1967. During this deeply problematic fair, created with the theme “Man and His World,” there was a significant moment for Canadian Landscape architecture and play theory. Cornelia Hahn Oberlander was commissioned to design a playground for the fair, exemplifying a new way to think about how we play. She proposed an adventure playground. 
<br>
<img src="skate or text/skate7.jpg" alt="the essay of loose parts" width="100%">
<br>
An adventure playground is defined by an ethos of unrestricted play. They look like scrap yards with loose tires, blocks of wood, rope, tools, and nails scattered around. Liberated from adult enforced structures, these spaces empower kids by allowing them to create and build with “risky” materials. Children are free to build and destroy their surroundings as they choose. 
<br>
This playground theory is transferable to skate spaces and perhaps why DIY spots I think are often most loved by the community. When you build something yourself there is more connection and understanding of the site. Furthermore, having modular features in a skate space makes it more accessible to varying skill levels, physical abilities, and styles.
<br>
I first made the connection between the ethos of adventure playgrounds in skate spaces when I worked on an artistic  research project focusing on vacancy in the city currently known as “Montréal.”  (“Montreal” was built on the unceded and traditional territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation, with neighbouring territories of the Kahnawà:ke and Kanehsatá:ke Nations. The history of the original stewards is embedded in the place name “Tiohtià:ke”, which is a shortened version of “Teionihtiohtiá:kon” roughly meaning “where the group divided/parted ways”.)  
<br>
While living in Tiohtià:ke / “Montreal” I worked with a collective called “Making Art Making Politics” that was a collaboration between the Alternative Political Party of Denmark and faculty, artists, and academics of Concordia University. We were tremendously fortunate to work on a project in the Canadian Pavilion from Expo 67. The pavilion was situated in “Parc Jean Drapeau” in the periphery of “Montreal” and it had been sitting vacant for years.
<br>
We created a project entitled Adventure Skateground. It was a site-specific project which applied Hahn’s playground theory from 1967 to an artist-run skate space. It was created in 2018 by a collective of women, queer, non-binary, and feminist artists/skaters as a
response to the often white-cis-hetero-patriarchal culture of skateboarding. Adventure Skateground aimed at reclaiming space for underrepresented folks in skateboarding. It was built and painted with found materials by the users. The element of art making in the project proved to be a great way to keep folks with physical, social, and mental barriers towards skateboarding involved in the project. Together, we tried to design the Skateground to be intentionally inclusive, non-binary, and beginner friendly.
<br>
It began as a sculpture garden with skate-able and non-skate-able objects scattered across the floor of the vacant theatre. Calling the objects ‘sculptures’ thinly disguised what we were really doing: building a prohibited skatepark and actively encouraging and facilitating its use. That being said, the white-cis-hetero-patriarchal history of the site somehow validated our “rebellious” intervention. Bright colours and soft materials made obstacles less intimidating and more inviting. By rewriting some norms of skate culture and having the intent of inclusive community guidelines we were able to spread the empowerment and spontaneous 
 movement that skateboarding and art making can be.
<br>
 The Adventure Skateground was such a serendipitous time of growth and shared space so when I moved to “Fogo Island” I wondered if skateboarding with this participatory approach could make sense on a small North Atlantic island too. I moved in the middle of the harsh winter but when the ice started to melt in May, I found a big flat ground spot on a fishing wharf at the end of the “Town of Fogo”, one of the only flat, paved, careless spots on the entire island. For a while it was just me skating and getting funny looks from my fishermen neighbours, but in the summer months when a few more young people moved to the island I convinced some pals to get their first boards when we were on a road trip to “St. John’s”. Like the vacant theatre at “Parc Jean Drapeau”, “Fogo Island” was an ideal place for beginners to start skating, because it was in the periphery.
 <br>
 In June, a good friend and architect, Dihua Wei, helped me draw up a plan for two mini quarter pipes. We drew them with a very mellow transition because most of the skate community on the island had been riding for max. three weeks. Di always got involved with the artist-in-residences’ projects and helped make so many community projects come to life. If it wasn’t for Di being willing to try anything new, including skateboarding at 29 years old, I don’t think skateboarding would have caught on that summer. Sometimes it just takes one other person to make a project come to life. Together with the funnest family of architect and artist combo Erin Hunt and Kingman Brewster and their super creative and hilarious family friends, we built and painted two mini, movable quarter pipes.

      I wrote this four months after moving back West from “Fogo Island”.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>

It’s the eighth day of the COVID-19 quarantine here and my first time encountering a global pandemic with social isolation measures. That being said, after moving to an island of 2500 people in the middle of the winter - alone - isolation feels rather familiar. 
<br><br>
 There are similarities in the time spent there and the paradigm now. Limited access to goods and services, solitude, performing various activities in “undesignated” spaces, staying within a small travel radius and often moving places by foot. Slowing down, the potential of dating shrunken, grappling with how to balance screen time as it becomes the emphasized way to connect socially, and making things yourself. The ideas we discuss in this publication about islands as sites for DIY feel even more relevant in this era of social isolation. As history cycles through, the notion of the periphery is beginning to dissolve and the lines between rural and urban fade. Self-determination returns to focus. In this paradigm, your community is your island.
<br><br>
 I’m sitting alone in “China Creek Park,” a public skatepark and garden not far from my current rental home. It’s one of the oldest public skateparks in this city, and since skateboarding began on Turtle Island/“North America” it may be one of the oldest in the world. The park is built on unceded Coast Salish land, including the territories of the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil- Waututh) Nations. You may know this place by the name “Vancouver.”
<br><br>
 It’s a sunny spring day but I feel a doom and a darkness inside. I’m scared about what sort of pressure this will put on an already shaky foundation of the globalized and colonized world. I am privileged to have the space to take social distance and within this racist, classist, ableist system, I know this pandemic will have much more serious and horrifying consequences on lives that aren’t mine. We need to stand in solidarity, not charity, with anti-racist movements to dismantle these oppressive systems. Not just now but always. It’s evident now more than ever that white supremacy is the pandemic.
<br><br>
 I look across the park and see two kids playing with a kite. They are helping each other throw it up in the air and run around as fast as they can so it catches in the wind. It soars above their small, running bodies until either they, or the wind, run out of energy. 
<br><br>
 The kite is made out of a thin, vibrantly coloured, synthetic fabric that glows in the sun. The way it catches invisible energy in the sky feels like some sort of visual representation of the way joy is experienced, jolting through your body. For whatever reason, watching them play makes me cry. Tears stream down my face and a meditation on play and survival begins in my mind.
 <br><br>
 I think to myself: what is play really and why exactly do children have such an amazing and - perhaps naive - ability to play even in times of crisis?
<br><br>
 I think about:
<br><br>
 	Play theory
<br><br>
 		early childhood development 
<br><br>
                                              	     mental health
<br><br>
                                                 	                  education
<br><br>
                                                                                           toys 
<br><br>
and what all these things have in common with empowering or disempowering the user or the maker. I think about toy design and the introduction of manufactured toys to play and what this may have changed for our development as autonomous beings. I wonder if there would be a difference in the way these kids play with a store-bought kite vs. one that they made themselves. Would they carry and set it down on the ground differently? Perhaps with more care? Or maybe with more risk, because they possess the tools and knowledge to put it back together?
<br><br>
My mind moves to how I would like to make a kite. Funnily, at my age…and given that I went to art school, if I made a kite it may register as an art object or a sculpture instead of a toy. Even though I want to make one for the same reasons. I want to make a kite to run in the park and feel the way those kids feel. I wonder why we need to make things with such authority and what effect that has on our mental health and ability to problem solve.
<br><br>
I rack my brain for what materials I already have at home, to avoid making a non-essential trip to the store. These anti-capitalist parameters are a nice place to start asking questions of what a process could and should look like with less access to commercial goods and services. What is a good way to collect materials and why do we make the things we make? The social distancing is bringing us back to place-based and community centred making and it gives me some sort of hope. 
<br><br>
I look up and see the kids running really fast, this time with lots of wind catching the wings of the kite.
<br><br>
As it flaps my mind flutters to visions of what my kite would look like. I imagine the large scale paper maché sculptures made for the Bread and Puppet outdoor theatre shows and the kites in Colin Low’s short film “Children of Fogo Island.” I adore this film because It visually articulates so many of the loose parts in the spider web of my artistic research. Play theory, folk art and craft, participatory filmmaking, DIY making, and the periphery. 
<br><br>
Made in 1967, Low’s 18 minute black and white film documents children dancing and playing on the North Atlantic “Fogo Island” with toys and games they made themselves. From wood, textiles, string and other regional materials, they have created their own handmade mini houses, rafts, airplanes, boats, kites, and stilts. The first time I saw the film I fell in love with the handmade quality of the objects. Their outfits and toys look as if they were made by the artists of my dreams. Aesthetically, there are childlike, loose gestures of pastoral, naive, or folk art languages mixed with the reduction of the modernist context. 
<br><br>
About five minutes into the film, there is a scene of two little ones floating a DIY airplane across the ocean bay. Stretched across the side of the plane are hand painted letters which read: “EXPO 67.” A reminder that this moment was happening simultaneously to the international fair held in “Montreal, Quebec” in 1967. During this deeply problematic fair, created with the theme “Man and His World,” there was a significant moment for Canadian Landscape architecture and play theory. Cornelia Hahn Oberlander was commissioned to design a playground for the fair, exemplifying a new way to think about how we play. She proposed an adventure playground. 
<br><br>
<img src="skate or text/skate7.jpg" alt="the essay of loose parts" width="100%">
<br><br>
An adventure playground is defined by an ethos of unrestricted play. They look like scrap yards with loose tires, blocks of wood, rope, tools, and nails scattered around. Liberated from adult enforced structures, these spaces empower kids by allowing them to create and build with “risky” materials. Children are free to build and destroy their surroundings as they choose. 
<br><br>
This playground theory is transferable to skate spaces and perhaps why DIY spots I think are often most loved by the community. When you build something yourself there is more connection and understanding of the site. Furthermore, having modular features in a skate space makes it more accessible to varying skill levels, physical abilities, and styles.
<br><br>
I first made the connection between the ethos of adventure playgrounds in skate spaces when I worked on an artistic  research project focusing on vacancy in the city currently known as “Montréal.”  (“Montreal” was built on the unceded and traditional territory of the Kanien’kehá:ka Nation, with neighbouring territories of the Kahnawà:ke and Kanehsatá:ke Nations. The history of the original stewards is embedded in the place name “Tiohtià:ke”, which is a shortened version of “Teionihtiohtiá:kon” roughly meaning “where the group divided/parted ways”.)  
<br><br>
While living in Tiohtià:ke / “Montreal” I worked with a collective called “Making Art Making Politics” that was a collaboration between the Alternative Political Party of Denmark and faculty, artists, and academics of Concordia University. We were tremendously fortunate to work on a project in the Canadian Pavilion from Expo 67. The pavilion was situated in “Parc Jean Drapeau” in the periphery of “Montreal” and it had been sitting vacant for years.
<br><br>
We created a project entitled Adventure Skateground. It was a site-specific project which applied Hahn’s playground theory from 1967 to an artist-run skate space. It was created in 2018 by a collective of women, queer, non-binary, and feminist artists/skaters as a
response to the often white-cis-hetero-patriarchal culture of skateboarding. Adventure Skateground aimed at reclaiming space for underrepresented folks in skateboarding. It was built and painted with found materials by the users. The element of art making in the project proved to be a great way to keep folks with physical, social, and mental barriers towards skateboarding involved in the project. Together, we tried to design the Skateground to be intentionally inclusive, non-binary, and beginner friendly.
<br><br>
It began as a sculpture garden with skate-able and non-skate-able objects scattered across the floor of the vacant theatre. Calling the objects ‘sculptures’ thinly disguised what we were really doing: building a prohibited skatepark and actively encouraging and facilitating its use. That being said, the white-cis-hetero-patriarchal history of the site somehow validated our “rebellious” intervention. Bright colours and soft materials made obstacles less intimidating and more inviting. By rewriting some norms of skate culture and having the intent of inclusive community guidelines we were able to spread the empowerment and spontaneous 
 movement that skateboarding and art making can be.
<br><br>
 The Adventure Skateground was such a serendipitous time of growth and shared space so when I moved to “Fogo Island” I wondered if skateboarding with this participatory approach could make sense on a small North Atlantic island too. I moved in the middle of the harsh winter but when the ice started to melt in May, I found a big flat ground spot on a fishing wharf at the end of the “Town of Fogo”, one of the only flat, paved, careless spots on the entire island. For a while it was just me skating and getting funny looks from my fishermen neighbours, but in the summer months when a few more young people moved to the island I convinced some pals to get their first boards when we were on a road trip to “St. John’s”. Like the vacant theatre at “Parc Jean Drapeau”, “Fogo Island” was an ideal place for beginners to start skating, because it was in the periphery.
<br><br>
 In June, a good friend and architect, Dihua Wei, helped me draw up a plan for two mini quarter pipes. We drew them with a very mellow transition because most of the skate community on the island had been riding for max. three weeks. Di always got involved with the artist-in-residences’ projects and helped make so many community projects come to life. If it wasn’t for Di being willing to try anything new, including skateboarding at 29 years old, I don’t think skateboarding would have caught on that summer. Sometimes it just takes one other person to make a project come to life. Together with the funnest family of architect and artist combo Erin Hunt and Kingman Brewster and their super creative and hilarious family friends, we built and painted two mini, movable quarter pipes.

        Did you hear it?
        Fuzzy underbellies of Labrador tea leaves 
<br>
        When hot and sweaty shout out for glee. 
<br>
        Pink petals of Lupine speak of the sea. 
<br>
        St. John’s wart whispers caramel and cream.

        Did you hear them each tell the wool

        what they know and what they have seen?
<br><br><br><br>
        During the summer of 2019, I made my first dye book of plants found on Fogo Island. I walked every day and during these moving meditations I would forage for natural dyes. Walking and skating up and down the hills, I collected Labrador Tea and Crow Berries. Along the roadside, I gathered Lupines, Golden Rod and Fireweed. With a little research and patience, I began to learn the art and science of natural dyeing. It feels pretty badass to be able to look outside and understand how the elements and plant life come together to offer a spectrum of colours - how an entire language exists underneath the epidermis of a leaf. All we really have to do is
<br><br><br>
        						Listen.
<br><br>
        Colour can serve as an intermediary language between humans and plants. (So, how do we listen through colour?) Natural dyes are made by extracting tannins from organic matter (also known as dye stuff) and reattaching itself to aggravated natural fibres. Information on the plant and its environment can be gathered through visual observation. The history of a plant is recorded onto fabric through colour. Contaminants in water or the time of year a plant is harvested can affect the hue and saturation produced. Being able to maintain consistency when dyeing, allows for subtle changes to be observed and linked back to the plant and the place it is from. 
<br>
        I began to learn ecology by learning a craft. ‘Listening through colour’ is a collaboration of two components: the sense of sight and one’s own creative expression. However, learning through visual observation may not be a useful option for everyone, and it is important to note there are many other ways to listen and learn from plants. While colour and natural dyeing is referred to throughout this book, in addition to this craft, I am also advocating for the act of slowing down and looking around.
<br><br>
        Listening and reciprocity skills can be taught through building stronger relationships to plants; Learning what they can do for us, and in turn, what we can do for them. What I found is, as I listened to plants I got better at observing and listening to the people and the community around me as well. 
<br><br>
        Building a healthy relationship to vegetation while foraging depends on mutual care. Don’t pillage a plant population, only forage when it is respectful to do so. (Ask questions like: “Will my harvesting stress this plant out?”) Learn the history of the plant: its scarcity, its herbal/spiritual uses and its contribution to its ecosystem. (“Can I appreciate this plant without exploiting it?” *cough* *cough* of course you can!) Be extra caution if working with, or considering, the use of native plants. Being respectful of native plants is especially important to me as a white settler/occupier. About 25-30 percent of plant species native to “Canada” are deemed rare, a result of colonization. Some of these endangered native plants have traditional indigenous significance. It is critical not to take native plants with cultural significance if you are not indigenous as they should be left for indigenous folks to use. 
<br><br>
        Some great advice for respectful foraging was suggested to us by friend/skater/artist, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mccranki/"> Kalea Ranger McCrank </a>, who grew up foraging with her mother and is practicing to be an herbalist. A few tips she shared while harvesting lupines this spring were: 
<br><br>
        1) Research the plant and its cultural/ecological significance before foraging. 
 <br><br>
        2) Check in with yourself when you arrive at the plant. Think of your intention for foraging in your heart. Does this feel okay?
 <br><br>
        3) Slow down and ask the plant if it’s okay to take. Sense if there are any signs that feel like a “no” or “yes.”
 <br><br>
        4) If you feel consent is granted, choose which plants you take from wisely. Harvest from the established plants that are going to seed or look closer to the end of their bloom. Leave the younger, more vulnerable plants to grow. Avoid taking fresh budding plants.
 <br><br>
        5) You want to harvest in a way that looks like you were never there. For stem flowers, trim down right above the growing tip. This is where there is bud forming on the plant. If cut strategically, the energy will go into the growing tip and foraging can increase growth.
 <br><br>
        6) If the plant you are harvesting has seeds, spread some as you trim. Imagine yourself as a pollinator, assisting in the reproduction! 
 <br><br>
        Foraging is one way to find dye-stuff. There are many ways to engage with growth and waste systems, each providing unique opportunities . 

        <img src="dye text/dye3.jpg" alt="types of plants..." width="100%">
 <br><br>
        Consider the following as alternatives to foraging:
<br><br>
        1) Urban gleaning is the collection of food (and materials) that would have otherwise gone to waste. Urban gleaning, for example, is harvesting the fruit from public trees that would usually fall and rot. It could be dumpster diving or talking to your local grocery store about collecting expired produce. At its roots, urban gleaning is looking at using other people’s waste. 
<br><br>
        2) Using food scraps can be a great way to use your own waste. There are a lot of resources online about how to use common household food waste to make dyes. Avocado pit dye is an example of a great colourfast option (see pg. 211 for a definition of colourfast). Some other food waste dye ideas are: onion skins, pomegranates, black bean water (as in the water you use to cook dried beans in) and walnut shells. There are a lot of colours in your compost bin to discover! 
<br><br>
        3) Start your own natural dye garden. This can be a great way not only to have a ready supply of dyestuff in your backyard but also an opportunity to grow native plants. On our visit to “St. John’s” last summer, we visited Susan Furneux, an artist and natural dye specialist in “Conception Harbour.” Susan has been growing her own dye material for years. When we visited Susan, we worked with the goldenrod and the Japanese indigo she grew. 
<br><br>
        Pause, as you might  see already I do not write with an authoritative voice. My recipes and advice serve as an introduction to natural dyeing. I am in no way an expert on the subject or on the plants discussed. I am not a steward of the land and I talk as an uninvited guest/occupier. What I share is my learning regarding my relationship to the land and my recipes as poetic instructions in listening and ecology.  
<br><br>
        Natural dyeing is used here as a communication tool and not for an industrial purpose. The type of dye practice shown in this book focuses on play, embodied research and listening. Its structure is more akin to DIY skateboarding than a traditional book of dye recipes-we are working with what the environment provides us with to express creativity.  What I share is a natural dye practice in the specific environment of “Fogo Island”. I used what was around me to create dyes. These dyes and teachings are here to be mimicked and inspire a deviant dye practice relative to your specific environment, tools, and community. Enjoy the recipes and ramblings as an instruction book on dyeing and mediations on listening and production.
